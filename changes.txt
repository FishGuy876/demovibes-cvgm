July 9th, 2018
* Finally took some time to put this repo together and commit it to GitHub for the rest of the world. This initial upload consists of the original GoogleCode tree, with a few tweaks here and there.

Jan 3rd, 2015
* New year, new changes! Merged the old folder structure from cvgm-merge to stable, and cvgm-unstable to experimental to better seperate the two trees.
* Both trees are currently the exact same, until something happens in the experimental trees.
