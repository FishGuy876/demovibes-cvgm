demosauce - fancy icecast source client
dscan     - fancy music scanning tool

BUILDING
==================
officially we support only linux, but there is a good chance it will build on other unixy systems. for linux and bsd you can use installDependencies.sh to install all the required libs.

Libraries
------------------
required libs:
libmp3lame, libshout, libavcodec, libavformat, libswresample, libchromaprint

bundlesd libs:
replaygain, openmpt, hively

optional libs:
bass

If BASS cannot be found after successfully compiling the tools, copy the libs/libbass.so to the /usr/lib/ folder so it can be found (debian) or /usr/local/lib/ (Ubuntu). If you still have issues, use ldd to figure out where it's looking for the library files. FishGuy876

BASS is a proprietary lib for module playback (mod, s3m, xm, it, etc). it is widely used in the demoscene and most modules are tested against it. the configure script can download the lib if required.  http://www.un4seen.com/bass.html.

SETUP
==================
copy contrib/demosauce.conf.example to demosauce.conf. then edit it. the comments will guide you.

RUN
==================
you can either run demosauce with a full demovibes server (which demosauce was written for) or provide your own script. that script will listen on a certain port for a command (NEXTSONG) upon which it will return information about the next song to be played. the format is a couple of key-value pairs. if you're using demosauce with demovibes, just run the sockulf.py script in the demobibes directory. for a simple custom example script, check contrib/simple-sockulf.py. it will use all playable files in a directory in a random order.  to control demosauce while it's running, use contrib/demosauce-control.py.

LICENSE
==================

FAQ
==================
if you have a question, find me on scenestream.net

the control script can send the following extra key=value pairs to control playback.

general
------------------
gain        : gain value, in dB?
length      : force length (seconds), values below 0 are ignored
fade_out    : fade out at end of song (false | true)
mix         : stero mix (auto | 0.0 - 0.5)

bass only
------------------
bass_inter  : auto | off | linear | sinc
bass_ramp   : auto | off | normal | sensitive
bass_mode   : auto | pt1 | ft2
