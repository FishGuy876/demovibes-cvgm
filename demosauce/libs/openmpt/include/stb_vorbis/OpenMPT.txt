This folder contains the stb_vorbis library from
https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_vorbis.c
(commit 6f6e11f85fd5c14bc9e9eb5edafb1b5dabd515d0

Modifications:
 *  Use of alloca has been replaced with malloc, as alloca is not in C99 and
    fails to compile.
 *  Macro redefinition of STB_VORBIS_NO_STDIO has been fixed.
Modifications are always additions and have been marked with // OpenMPT.

For building, premake is used to generate Visual Studio project files.
See ../build/premake/ for details.
