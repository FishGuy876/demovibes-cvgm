This theme was created as a modified version of FishGuy876's default CVGM gray styled theme. This theme is distributed as part of the Demovibes-cvgm project and may be used freely with credit.

Changes:

* version 1.01
* 081111 - Top/Bottom borders of notification "Guru Meditation" window added according to Terrasque's know-how \o/

* version 1.02
* 070112 - Oneliner username/onelinertime moved into table-cell formatting with some
*          additional workaround text <br> formatting of p.onelinermsg

* version 1.03
* 170212 - Oneliner changed from table-cell into block formatting because of problems with Opera
* 180212 - Changed messagefadeborder to remove overdrawing bottom border of notification window
* 170712 - Fixed colors for edit fields on the "New Compilation" page (thx bpoint)

* version 1.04
* 140912 - Added some ommited form fields to "select, input, textarea {" area
*          Fixed screenshot page, flowing of list of connected songs (#screenshot-data)

 * version 1.05
 * 141212 - Increased height of the lists for artists & groups on song upload and song edit pages.
	   Let's say "good-bye" to searching through huge lists with three line high selector.

 * version 1.06
 * 161212 - Small gfx facelifting in side panels (smoother vertical edges).
 *          Replaced poem of IDs with single select, input, textarea. It sinked 3D effect for submit button,
 *          so it was excluded with specialisation for type=submit.

 * version 1.07
 * 171212 - Fields on song upload/edit pages are now wider/bigger (filename, info, comments,
 *          artist, etc.) (thx Falken)

 * version 1.08
 * 191017 - Artist's photo now scales to 80% of the main column, so we can have larger pictures without affecting
 *          information column next to the photo for smaller browser windows. Also artist information text panel
 *          is forced to be 240px wide, so short lines of info should not split. (thx again to Falken)

 * version 1.09
 * 240519 - Right panel width increased to 230px to accomodate bigger YT embedded videos
