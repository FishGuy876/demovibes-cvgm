ChangeLog

July 27th, 2018
* Moved the settings_local.py file to the Contrib folder to prevent accidental overwrites in future commits.
* Documented some of the settings in the same file a little bit more.
* Added some notes to the install document. Added a fix for uwsgi compilation. Thanks Greg!
* Removed a bunch of crap from the repo that didnt need to be there and added a .gitignore file.

* Finally took some time to put this repo together and commit it to GitHub for the rest of the world. This initial upload consists of the original GoogleCode tree, with a few tweaks here and there.

Jan 3rd, 2015
* New year, new changes! Merged the old folder structure from cvgm-merge to stable, and cvgm-unstable to experimental to better seperate the two trees.
* Both trees are currently the exact same, until something happens in the experimental trees.
